# Signalling server

Need to start up signalling server before doing anything:

* cd server
* npm install
* node js/server.js

Signalling server runs on port 9000 by default.

# Security

* Source is available for verification
* Only data sent to central server is connection information
* Peer-to-peer channels are encrypted
* Glyphs file passes peer-to-peer to connected host
